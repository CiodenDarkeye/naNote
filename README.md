# naNoteCLI
 
naNote is a lightweight notetaking application, designed to allow people to avoid context switching as much as possible through a 'launcher'-style global popup with a hotkey. I am not a professional developer, but am looking to switch careers in that direction - naNote is an opportunity for me to practice the stuff I've been learning.

# Status

naNote is in pre-production and missing several major features - currently, I'm working on naNote.CMD as a commandline implementation in order to do some basic feature development in the logic library. I've got it up here so I can solicit feedback from folks I know, but it's far from complete.
